UPYACHKA, web page disease. Symptom: The page with images jerks and jumps during loading. Disease most often exposed long pages with large photos.

It happens when browser doesnâ€™t know dimensions of the images and cannot reserve space for them as it contructs the page.

## Medieval medicine

Earlier it were cured by simply specifying the width and height:

```html
<img src="smile.jpg" width="900" height="600" />
```

## Still sick

Today in the responsive era we want images to be rubber and add something like this:

```css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

Pictures become responsive, okay. But in that case because of `height:auto` browser must download the images to calculate their size and cannot reserve the appropriate space to it. Upyachka again here. Despite the specified `width` and `height`.

## Recipe

To cure upyachka, I wrote a tiny plugin that takes `width` and `height` attributes and calculates the size of every responsive image until browser fully loaded and handled them.

Please check the examples:

* [sick.html](http://artpolikarpov.github.io/upyachka.js/examples/sick.html)
* [cured.html](http://artpolikarpov.github.io/upyachka.js/examples/cured.html)

To cure your pages add the following to the `<head>` of your page:

```html
<script src="/path/to/jquery.min.js"></script> <!-- or Zepto -->
<script src="/path/to/upyachka.min.js"></script>
```

Specify both the height and width attributes for images.

Now the layout should be fixed and the images will pop into place when loaded.
